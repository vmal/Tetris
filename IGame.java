/**
 * Interface for a Tetris-like game. Implementations of instances of this
 * interface should maintain all aspects of the game state.  The state
 * consists of a grid of IPolyomino objects representing occupied
 * and unoccupied positions, plus a current IPolyomino whose position is
 * normally updated by the step() method and can be altered by the
 * rotate(), shiftLeft(), and shiftRight() methods.
 * An additional part of the game state is the status that is returned by
 * each invocation of the step() method.  The status values are described
 * in detail in the GameStatus documentation.
