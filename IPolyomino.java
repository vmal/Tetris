/**
 * Interface for polyominoes (game pieces made of multiple square blocks) used
 * by Tetris-like games. Each polyomino has a position and a set of Block
 * objects. The position is an (x,y) pair representing the upper left corner of
 * the bounding square. The position is represented by an instance of
 * java.awt.Point. The initial position is presumed to be given by a
 * constructor; thereafter it can be modified by the shiftX() and shiftY()
 * methods. Note that classes implementing this interface have no knowledge of
 * the grid on which the game is being played and
 * <em>no bounds checking is done in
 * implementations of this interface<em>. Therefore, the position can have
 * negative coordinates.
